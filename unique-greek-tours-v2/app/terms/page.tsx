              All Participants will be required to disclose, at the time of booking, or in any case prior to the commencement 
              of the Trip or Experience, whether the Participant suffers from any medical condition which may prevent the

              injury, angina or other heart condition, food allergy, dietary requirements or restrictions, severe or uncontrolled 
              asthma, visual impairment, depression or recovering from recent surgery. Given the nature of our Trips or Experiences, 
              we are not in the position to guarantee that all nutritional requirements will be met; however, we will make every 
              effort to meet your needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Participants acknowledge and agree that they participate in the Trip or Experience at their own risk.
            </p>
            <p>
              We do not include personal insurance with our Trips or Experiences. Unique Greek Tours recommends that customers 
              purchase individually their own travel insurance (or ask their travel agent). Unique Greek Tours will not be held

            </p>
            <p>
              All participants to a Trip or Experience must hold a valid ticket, voucher or confirmation letter. Entry may be 
              refused if tickets or vouchers are damaged or defaced in any way or not purchased from an authorised reseller.
            </p>

            <h2>Unique Greek Tours's Ability to Refuse Participation</h2>
            <p>
              Unique Greek Tours reserves the right to refuse any person, for whatever reason, participation in the tour, in its 
              absolute discretion, whether or not they have previously purchased a ticket. A person will be reimbursed for tickets 
              previously purchased should they be refused permission to participate on grounds other than those set out above.
            </p>

            <h2>Accessibility and Safety - Participant Guidelines</h2>
            <p>
              It should be noted that local conditions in Greece may differ from those that exist in the rest of Europe or the 
              U.S.A. The state and conditions of some streets may present accessibility difficulties. Access for persons with 
              special needs is not guaranteed. Public areas may not be accessible to persons with special needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Participation in our Trips or Experiences may require a minimum physical condition, such that you are in the 
              position to walk uphill or climb stairs. Kindly inform us if you have a medical or physical limitation or are 
              undergoing a medical treatment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unique Greek Tours will not be liable for the personal safety of participants, or for the safety of personal items, 
              nor for unforeseen events and incidents that Unique Greek Tours cannot control, prevent or avoid, including (but 
              not limited to) accidents, thefts and illnesses during the Trip or Experience. Each participant shall be fully 
              responsible for his/her personal health, medical needs and safety.
            </p>
            <p>
              We advise you to check your insurance contract in order to determine whether you are covered and to clarify what 
              your travel insurance covers in the case of trips abroad. For their own safety, all Participants must obey the 
              directions and instructions of the Experience guide, must not disturb other Participants or interfere with the 
              Trip or Experience guide's ability to conduct the Trip or Experience in a safe manner.
            </p>
            
            <h3>By joining a Unique Greek Tours Trip or Experience, each Participant is ensuring its own safety by agreeing to:</h3>
